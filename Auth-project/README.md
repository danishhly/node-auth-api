# Node Auth API

A secure and modular REST API built using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and JWT authentication. This project provides user registration, login, and protected routes, and is a great starter template for building full-stack apps.

---

## 🚀 Features

- User registration & login
- JWT-based authentication
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- MongoDB integration via Mongoose
- Modular route & controller structure
- Error handling middleware

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB + Mongoose
- JWT for authentication
- Bcrypt for password hashing
